# Diabolik Lovers STCM2L Editor
An editor for Diabolik Lovers script files.

## Prerequisites
.NET Framework 4.5 or higher

## Getting Started
First step for getting started on editing scripts is getting a copy of the ROM for the game.
After that you can follow the guide on [Wiki](https://github.com/kubo25/Diabolik-Lovers-STCM2L-Editor/wiki/Unpacking-the-ROM) to unpack the necessary files.

When you've unpacked all the necesary files it's time to get translating. Again on [Wiki](https://github.com/kubo25/Diabolik-Lovers-STCM2L-Editor/wiki/Using-the-editor) there is an user manual detailing all the funcionality of the editor if necessary.

After you've edited all the necessary files or you just want to see how the translation looks the ROM has to be repacked. As usual there is a guide on how to do this on [Wiki](https://github.com/kubo25/Diabolik-Lovers-STCM2L-Editor/wiki/Repacking-the-ROM).
