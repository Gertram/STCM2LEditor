# Diabolik Lovers STCM2L Editor
An editor for Diabolik Lovers script files.
## Getting Started
First step for getting started on editing some scripts is getting a copy of a ROM for the game (hopefully legally).
After that you can follow the guide on [Wiki](https://github.com/kubo25/Diabolik-Lovers-STCM2L-Editor/wiki) to unpack the necessary files.
